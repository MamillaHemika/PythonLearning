**1\. Anonymous Functions**

**Anonymous functions** are functions that are defined without a name. They are often used as arguments to other functions or as a quick way to define a function in a specific context.

\# Example of an anonymous function in Python

\# Anonymous function assigned to a variable

anon_func = lambda: print("This is an anonymous function")

**2\. Single Expression Functions**

**Single expression functions** are functions that consist of a single expression. These functions are designed to be concise and are often used in contexts where a simple computation or operation is needed. In some languages, like Python, single expression functions are created using the lambda keyword.

**Example in Python:**

Python

\# Single expression lambda function

single_expr_func = lambda x: x \* 2

\# Using the single expression function

print(single_expr_func(5)) # Output: 10

**3\. Inline Lambda Functions**

**Inline lambda functions** are lambda functions that are defined and used directly within the context they are needed, without being assigned to a variable. They are typically used in situations where a small, throwaway function is required.

**Example in Python:**

Python

\# Inline lambda function used in a map function

result = list(map(lambda x: x \* 2, \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]))

\# Output the result

print(result) # Output: \[2, 4, 6, 8, 10\]

**Summary**

- **Anonymous Functions:** Functions defined without a name, often assigned to variables or used as arguments.
- **Single Expression Functions:** Functions consisting of a single expression, often concise and used for simple operations.
- **Inline Lambda Functions:** Lambda functions defined and used directly within the context they are needed, without being assigned to a variable.

Each of these function types has its own use cases and advantages, depending on the specific requirements of the code.
